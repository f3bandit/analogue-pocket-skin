# Analogue Pocket Skin Template

An accurate template of the front of the Analogue Pocket for you to make your own skins! 
This Analogue Pocket skin template is provided in a number of file formats to make 
customising your Pocket all that easier.

## Usage
The bounding box for the images is:
- Width: `86.7mm` / `(8.67 cm)`
- Height: `69mm`  / `(6.9 cm)`

When applying the skin, the easiest technique is to line it up with the three 
smaller buttons and stick from there.

The SVG will give you the best results if you intend to cut single colour vinyl.

Feel free to use this for any purpose, even commercial!

## Contribute
If you do use it, or make improvements, all I ask is you make a Merge 
Request so others can use it too!

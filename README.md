# Analogue Pocket Skin

<img src="preview.jpg" alt="Preview" width="500" style="display:block; margin:auto; margin-bottom:15px" />

Hello! Here's like a 99% accurate psd of the Analogue Pocket for you to 
make your own skins! Was having troubles finding something after I got the 
cricut, so I made this!

Width: 86.5mm (8.65 cm)
Height: 68.5mm (6.85 cm)

Feel free to use this for any purpose, even commercial!

If you do use it, or make improvements, all I ask is you make a Merge 
Request so others (including myself) can use it too!

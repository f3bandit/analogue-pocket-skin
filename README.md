## Usage

### Front Skin

- Width: `86.7mm` / `(8.67 cm)`
- Height: `69mm` / `(6.9 cm)`

When applying the skin, the easiest technique is to line it up with the three
smaller buttons and stick from there.

The SVG will give you the best results if you intend to cut single colour vinyl.

### Cartridge

- Width: `62mm` / `(6.2 cm)`

Easiest to align from the bottom, right above the Cartridge slot (Above the metal parts)!
